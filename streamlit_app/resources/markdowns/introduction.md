**Carbon dioxide (CO2)** is a colourless, odourless and non-poisonous gas formed by combustion of carbon and in the respiration of living organisms and is considered a greenhouse gas.

**Carbon emissions** from the burning of fossil fuels is a primary cause of global warming. This happens to be one of the biggest threats facing humanity in the century. Although there are plenty of other greenhouse emissions ie. methane, nitrous oxide, and CFCs (chloroflourocarbon) gases, none compares to the magnitude of emission of carbon dioxide.

For this project we focused on CO2 emissions and its effect on the world we live in as well as some key factors and stats that may play a role in the emission of CO2 globally.
