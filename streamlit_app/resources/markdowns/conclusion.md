To some degree, we may be able to come up with future predictions for carbon emissions depending on a country's economic operations.

The results are not completely accurate, but the margin of error is expected, & leaning towards higher levels of emissions in some cases. The idea would be, it is better to over-estimate, since it ensures that the organizations are prepared for the worst case scenario.


### Parting Words
In this project, we were able to aggregate reliable economic data for the world with the aim of training machine learning models that would offer future predictions for carbon emission. We related the project to the notion of predicting carbon credits as well, a strategy employed by some countries & organizations to reduce their carbon emission footprints.
