In our project development, we attempted to respond to the following:
- Can we develop trained models that offer a reliable estimation of future carbon emissions based on developing infrastructure, industrialization & population?
- Can the predicted estimation be utilised in the implementation of carbon credits in-line with the Paris Agreement, 2016?
- Which factors weigh heavily towards determination of a countryâ€™s carbon emissions?
